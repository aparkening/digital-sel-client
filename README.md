The Digital SEL Client is the front-end of the Digital SEL, a digital humanities project whose aim is to
provide a sophisticated, interactive digital edition of the
[South English Legendary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_English_Legendary), an important
collection of [Middle English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_English)
[saints' lives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagiography) from the [Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages).

For more information about the project see the [Digital SEL Blog](http://blog.digitalsel.org/).
For a very early version of the project (written before the [maintainer](http://william-bolton.com/)
was a software engineer) see the [DigitalSEL.org](http://digitalsel.org/).

If you want to contribute, need help, or have any questions, feel free to reach out to
