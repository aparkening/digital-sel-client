              is a large collection of Middle English verse saints’ lives and related religious literature, originally composed in the late thirteenth century. The legendary was later revised and augmented, and its various forms enjoyed widespread readership, being copied until the fifteenth century. Today, the
               
              <i>
                SEL
              </i>
               
              survives in part or whole in more than 60 manuscripts. The legendary’s popularity and the readiness of later poets and scribes to revise and supplement the collection mean that there is a large degree of textual variation between individual witnesses of the
               
              <i>
                SEL
              </i>
              . Despite a great deal of work by earlier scholars, the

              has never been edited in whole and the editions that have appeared are typical of printed editions in that they present a base text with variations noted in a critical apparatus.

              The intent of the
               
              <i>
                Digital SEL
              </i>
               
              is to use a web-based application to create a kind of digital variorum edition of the text, which will allow users to view multiple versions of different
               
              <i>
                SEL
              </i>
               
              texts at the same time. The ultimate goal of the project is to provide a model of digital publishing that destabilizes the kind of editorial practice that imagines a “base” or “best” version of a text with variations noted in an apparatus.
